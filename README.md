# HSCC_Founders_DE
Differential expression analysis script for the HS-CC Founders strains. Script includes all figures produced for manscript as well as analysis.

Raw sequencing files (FASTQ), raw counts (STAR) and normalized counts (limma+voom TMM) are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus at accession ID GSE212000: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE212000.  

The analysis script requires the raw counts (STAR) file located at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE212000&format=file&file=GSE212000%5FHSCC%5FFounders%5FSTAR%5FCounts%2Etxt%2Egz. And the sample metadata file stores here as "HSCC_Founders_Metadata.csv"
